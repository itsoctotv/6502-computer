# Arduino based EEPROM Programmer
suitable for the AT28C256 EEPROM (possibly its derivitives)  
credits to [here](https://github.com/beneater/eeprom-programmer)
still WIP working on:  
- writing whole firmware files instead of in-code written bytes
- optimization (it takes ~5min to write the whole 256K EEPROM)
