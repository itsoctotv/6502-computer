# 6502-computer  
  
Building a 6502 retro style computer    
Mainly with the documentation/schematics and instruction videos of [Ben Eater](https://www.youtube.com/@BenEater)    
Current task is to just getting to know the hardware and software side of it eventually the goal is building a personal computer with actual PCBs (instead of breadboards), extension cards, full display and keyboard functionality. Similar to the Apple 1, Commodore type computers. (which will take a looong time)      

For the EEPROM Programmer I use the T48 from XGecu
    
For monitoring the I/O lines etc. of the 6502 I use a Arduino Mega programmed as a monitor device [here](6502-monitor/) (which is also way cheaper than a logic analyzer).    

For the clock I currently use the [555 style clock](https://eater.net/schematics/clock.png) but later I will be using a 1MHz oscillator clock
